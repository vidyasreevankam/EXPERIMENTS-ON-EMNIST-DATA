# EXPERIMENTS-ON-EMNIST-DATA
In task1 letter or digit classifier I used CNN architeture got accuracy of  88.23% on test data ran for 10 epochs each step 500
 by defining loss function as categorical cross entropy with optimizer adam.
In task 3 character recognition I used CNN which brought me accuracy of 87% on test data ran for 10 epochs.
In task2 I trained with CNN but this time with less no of trainable parameters compared to task1 and task3 got accuracy of 87.8% on test data.
